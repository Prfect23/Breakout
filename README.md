# Breakout
Classic breakout game in Processing

Here is a version of the classic breakout game, developed in Processing. I'd love it if you wanted to contribute or to throw ideas my way. I've had coding as a hobby for a number of years but never really done anything serious with it. It occured to me that GitHub offers a way to collaborate on projects and to get feedback - so feel free to offer advice or suggestions if the mood takes you. Otherwise, I think I'm just happy to have a place to post a project when it's done : )
